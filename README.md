##Use Case Why is this app useful?  Artist of every genre and people looking for shows both have something in common.
They're both intrested in the hottest venues but the problem with randomly using various search engines is the results are often not tailored to the indivdual needs of the seeker,  while instead returing various competing websites who paid to reach the top tier of results, but not necessarily providing the exact location and Url of the most relevant venues. My app is designed to find only the most relevant venue location data and Url sought by the searcher. The app doesn't search for anything else but show venues tailored to the needs of artist of various genres and people looking for the most interesting venues in thoes genres.  As an additional bouns it also provides advertising to the venues produced by the search. This in essence brings all of these groups together providing each with a unique way of finding the other. 



##This App works by first adding a search to the input then pressing the "savedSearches" button once the overlay is triggered. The saved searches can then be seen on the saved searches page.
